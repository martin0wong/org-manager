# Martin's Personal Project - Organization Structure Manager

## What will the application do?

- Visualizing the structure of the organisation from user input
  - Add / Delete entities under existing structure

- Keep track of headcount in different entities under the organisation
  - Plus / Minus headcount for easier macro management

- Add statistics under entities to show help analyze an entity
  - *examples:* 
    - police - crime numbers/types by districts
    - government - group/department efficiency (kpi satisfaction%, etc)

## Who will use it?

Anyone! If you have a need to manage your organisation (e.g. online groups), 
this tool will help you.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

Previous experience from online groups sparked my interest on this project.
Structures were hard to keep track of as stuff keeps changing whenever leadership feels like it, 
confusing the regular members and in some cases command members as well.

Hopefully, with this project, such messy structure will be much easier to
follow by members in such groups. 
While also improving transparency of organisations by making data more accessible, bridging digital divide.
